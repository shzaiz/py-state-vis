# Simple Python State Visualizer

## Overview

The `Visualizer` class provides a powerful way to visualize Python objects, including their attributes and relationships, in a graphical format using the Graphviz DOT language. It handles various data types, including primitives, lists, dictionaries, and custom objects, allowing for a clear understanding of complex data structures.


## Installation

To use the `Visualizer`, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pydot
```

You may also need Graphviz installed on your system to render the graphs. You can download it from [Graphviz's official site](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
